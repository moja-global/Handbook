What does the increase in CO2 mean for forests?
===============================================

Alongside warmer temperatures, climate change is associated with higher
atmospheric CO2. This increase in CO2 causes plants to reduce the tiny
openings present on their leaves, known as the
`stomata <https://byjus.com/biology/stomata/>`__. The reduction of the
stomata allows plants to use less soil water and photosynthesize more,
changing the availability of soil water to other plants. This enhanced
photosynthesis and modified water availability can cause changes in the
amount of leaf, root, and below-ground microbial biomass, which can
change our ecosystem. It is important to note that although climate
change results in high atmospheric CO2, it also brings about warming,
which can cause plants to use a lot more water and photosynthesize less.
The survival of the plants largely depends on whether the benefits
gained from high atmospheric CO2 are significant enough to compensate
for the stress experienced due to high temperatures. Learn more here :footcite:t:`2019:PNAS`.
