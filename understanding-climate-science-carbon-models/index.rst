Chapter-1: Understanding climate science & carbon models
==========================================================

This chapter discusses climate models, and to convey their usefulness,
we need to understand disturbances. We can recognise disturbances as
events, such as fires, flooding, insect and pest outbreaks, etc., that
cause short-term or temporary changes to the landscape. Although the
changes to the landscapes can be short-termed, disturbances can have
significant ecosystem impacts.

Carbon models evaluate how artificial or natural disturbances affect our
forests. Understanding these disturbances provides us with important
information about the future of our landscapes and the steps to take to
lessen their negative consequences.

Pools, Stocks and flows
-----------------------

Pools are reservoirs or containers that can hold, accumulate, or
discharge chemicals. Nature contains pools in the ocean, the
lithosphere, soils, atmosphere, and other places. A carbon pool, for
instance, stores and releases carbon.

Stock refers to the entire amount of a substance in a pool at any time. On 
the other hand, flows are measured in units per time and alter the
stock in a pool.

The bathtub analogy is a great way to explain these concepts. A bathtub
holding the water can be considered a pool, the faucet and drain can be
understood as flows, and the total water in the bathtub as stock.

Simulation models, States and Transition
-----------------------

Simulation models help provide valuable insights into the dynamics of
these landscapes. To run a simulation model, we must define the area or
landscape we want to study at a particular time. This landscape is
divided into small pixels to be simulated.

A pixel can be classified by its state, which might change over time;
for example, simple forest vegetation can have different states like
Deciduous, Mixed, and Coniferous. Due to transitions, the forest
vegetation can change to a different state over time.

State transitions can be due to fire, harvest, and succession
disturbances. These transitions impact the stocks and flows of carbon
pools.
