Using FLINT to mitigate climate change
=============================================================

`Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) <https://moja.global/flint/>`__ is
a moja global software used for measuring, reporting, verifying (MRV),
or forecasting greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forestry,
agriculture, and other land uses (AFOLU). With FLINT, we can use data
from multiple sources to simulate past events and project the
progression of a landscape.
