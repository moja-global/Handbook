Chapter 2: Introduction to the Full Lands Integration Tool
===========================================================

`Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) <https://moja.global/flint/>`_ is a modular, flexible, and open-source software that enables users to measure, report, verify and forecast greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forestry, agriculture, and other land users. 

Built primarily on simulating events and processes, FLINT captures, curates, and outputs the data from the simulations in different forms depending on a user's needs.
